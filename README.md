Problem Statement:
Flood rescue operations are critical and require efficient coordination and deployment of
resources. However, current methods of managing these operations can be time-consuming
and prone to errors. The problem is to develop an application that can improve the efficiency
and effectiveness of flood rescue operations by providing user-friendly design and UI, storing
admin's details for future references, providing real-time information on affected areas, and
making task-assigning to teams more innovative and easy.
